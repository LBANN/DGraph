## GraphCast

DGraph implementatio of GraphCast. 

The GraphCast implementation is on the implementation available from [DeepMind](https://github.com/google-deepmind/graphcast)
 and [NVIDIA's Modulus implementation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/examples/weather/graphcast).

### Simulated Dataset

GraphCast is originally trained on the ERA5 dataset from 1979-2017. The dataset is quite large and require substantial computational resources. There for we provide a simulated dataset that matches the original graph structure and connectivity but uses random data for atmospheric variables.
